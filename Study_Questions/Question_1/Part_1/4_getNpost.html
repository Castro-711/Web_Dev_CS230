	// again this is simply for the use of easier commenting

	// I am not sure about the diagram it is talking about but 
	// the differences between get and post are:

	// GET:
	// can be cached
	// requests remain in browser history
	// requests can be bookmarked
	// requests should never be used to transmit sensitive data
	// requests have length restrictions
	// requests should only be used to retrieve data

	// POST:
	// requests are never cached
	// requests do not remain in the browser history
	// requests cannot be bookmarked 
	// requests have no restrictions on data lenght

	// he is looking for a diagram also, I am not really sure what it is
	// checked online couldnt find it. If yous know please let us know.

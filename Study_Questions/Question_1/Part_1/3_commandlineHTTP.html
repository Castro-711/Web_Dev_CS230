	// to make a request using the commmand line you can use two commands
	// - curl
	// - nc --> netcat

	// in his video nc did not work so just used curl for it.

	// curl -O http://localhost/notice.html
	// ^^^^^ -> that will return the notice.html and save it with the filename -> notice.html
	// within whatever directory you are in when you run the command

	// curl --head http://loaclhost/notice.html
	// ^^^^^ -> will return the head of the http, test this with a website you know.
